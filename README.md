## Project Title 🧰
US Bikeshare Dataset Analysis.

## Description ℹ️
One project in Udacity’s Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program. In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The program takes in input from the user in an interactive manner in the terminal. It will import the data, process the user input, and answer the following questions:

### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* a most common day of week
* most common hour of the day

### 2. Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* the most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3. Trip duration
* total travel time
* average travel time

### 4. User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Files used 🗂
we will need the three city dataset files too:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
